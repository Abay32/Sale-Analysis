# Electronic Sale Analysis

In this analytics, we will analyze the sales of an electronic shop. Here we have a time series data and we try to answer a few question that the campany wants to understand. These are 

  1. What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
  2. Which city sold the most product?
  3. What time should we display advertisements to maximize likelihood of customer's buying product?
  4. What products are most often sold together?
  5. What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?
